## 2. Performance Impact on Raspberry Pi

### 2.1 CPU Overload
**Risk Level:** HIGH
- **Description:** Migration processes consume excessive CPU, impacting SDR operations
- **Current Baseline:** 60-70% CPU usage during normal operations
- **Migration Load:** Additional 20-30% expected

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- **Description:** Limited RAM (4GB/8GB) stressed during parallel operations
- **Current Usage:** 2.5GB typical, 3.5GB peak
- **Risk Threshold:** >3.8GB triggers OOM killer

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement memory usage monitoring alerts
- Create swap file (2GB) before migration
- Stagger service restarts to avoid concurrent startup
- Use memory-efficient migration scripts

### 2.3 SD Card I/O Bottleneck
**Risk Level:** HIGH
- **Description:** Heavy write operations during migration wear SD card
- **Impact:** System slowdown, potential corruption
- **SD Card Life:** Reduced by heavy writes

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Move logs to tmpfs during migration
- Use external USB storage for migration staging
- Implement write buffering for critical operations
- Monitor SD card health metrics

### 2.4 USB Bus Saturation
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- **Description:** HackRF + GPS + WiFi adapter compete for USB bandwidth
- **Current Usage:** 60% of USB 2.0 bandwidth
- **Risk:** Device disconnections under load

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Required Skills:** Systemd, Docker, Python environments, Git
- **Training Time:** Estimated 2-3 weeks

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Create role-specific training modules
- Develop troubleshooting runbooks
- Implement buddy system for knowledge transfer
- Record all migration procedures

### 3.2 Emergency Response Procedures
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- **Gap:** Limited experience with system recovery
- **Impact:** Extended downtime during failures

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Create visual troubleshooting flowcharts
- Implement one-command recovery scripts
- Conduct failure scenario drills
- Establish escalation procedures

### 3.3 New Tool Adoption
**Risk Level:** LOW
- **Changes:** New monitoring tools, automation scripts
- **Learning Curve:** 1 week estimated

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Provide hands-on workshops
- Create quick reference cards
- Implement gradual tool rollout
- Maintain legacy interfaces temporarily

## 4. Backup and Recovery Procedures

### 4.1 Configuration Backup Strategy
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL
```bash
# Automated backup script
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_DIR="/home/pi/migration_backups/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Critical configurations
cp -r /home/pi/stinky "$BACKUP_DIR/"
cp -r /home/pi/WigletoTAK "$BACKUP_DIR/"
cp -r /home/pi/HackRF "$BACKUP_DIR/"
cp -r /etc/systemd/system/*.service "$BACKUP_DIR/"

# Database snapshots
kismet_server --dump-state "$BACKUP_DIR/kismet_state.json"

# Compress and verify
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR.tar.gz" "$BACKUP_DIR"
sha256sum "$BACKUP_DIR.tar.gz" > "$BACKUP_DIR.tar.gz.sha256"
```

### 4.2 Rollback Procedures
**Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** 15 minutes
**Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** 1 hour

**Quick Rollback Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency rollback
ROLLBACK_POINT=$1
systemctl stop gps_kismet_wigle
cd /home/pi
tar -xzf "migration_backups/$ROLLBACK_POINT.tar.gz"
./restore_services.sh
```

## Conclusion

The migration carries significant risks due to the integrated nature of the system and Raspberry Pi hardware constraints. However, with proper preparation, staged execution, and clear rollback procedures, these risks can be managed effectively. The key success factors are:

1. Comprehensive backup strategy
2. Staged migration approach
3. Clear go/no-go decision points
4. Well-trained team
5. Tested rollback procedures

**Recommendation:** Proceed with migration only after all pre-migration criteria are met and a full dry run has been completed successfully on a test system.
