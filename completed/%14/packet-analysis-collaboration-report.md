## Task Summary
Designed comprehensive real-time visualization and UI interaction patterns for the Fusion packet analysis system.

## Completed Deliverables

### 1. Real-Time Visualization Strategy
- Multi-layer architecture (network graph + metrics + anomalies)
- WebGL acceleration for high-performance rendering  
- Smart aggregation and sampling for high packet volumes
- Progressive rendering with Web Workers
- Svelte stores for reactive updates

### 2. UI Interaction Patterns

#### Packet Filtering Controls
- Real-time filter preview with visual feedback
- Quick filters and advanced options
- Smart suggestions from current traffic
- Smooth transition animations

#### Anomaly Alert Prioritization  
- Draggable threshold controls
- User-adjustable weight system
- Smart grouping of similar alerts
- Visual severity encoding with animations

#### Export/Save Functionality
- Multi-format support (PCAP, JSON, CSV, Report)
- Export templates for repeated workflows
- Progress tracking with size estimates
- Visualization export capabilities

### 3. Performance Monitoring System
- Adaptive quality adjustment (Ultra/High/Medium/Low)
- Multi-tier buffering strategy (Hot/Warm/Cold)
- Real-time performance HUD
- Resource usage visualization
- Performance alert system with auto-optimization
