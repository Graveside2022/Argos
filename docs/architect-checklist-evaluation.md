2. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Add dedicated NFR section with measurable targets
3. **Disaster Recovery**: Document backup and recovery procedures for edge devices

### Medium Priority:
1. **Service Mesh**: Consider documenting inter-service communication patterns
2. **Feature Flags**: Add feature toggle strategy for gradual rollouts
3. **Capacity Planning**: Include resource requirements for different deployment scales

### Low Priority:
1. **Internationalization**: Add i18n strategy if multi-language support needed
2. **Accessibility**: Document WCAG compliance approach
3. **GraphQL Alternative**: Consider documenting GraphQL option for complex queries
