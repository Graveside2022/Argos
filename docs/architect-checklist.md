## Scoring Guide
- **Excellent (90-100%)**: Production-ready architecture with comprehensive documentation
- **Good (70-89%)**: Solid architecture with minor gaps in documentation
- **Adequate (50-69%)**: Basic architecture covered but significant areas need improvement
- **Poor (Below 50%)**: Major architectural concerns or incomplete documentation

## Best Practices Not to Miss
1. **Offline-First Design** - Critical for field operations
2. **Hardware Abstraction** - Essential for SDR device management
3. **Real-time Data Streaming** - WebSocket architecture for live updates
4. **Spatial Indexing** - R-tree optimization for geographic queries
5. **Edge Deployment** - SystemD service configuration
6. **Security Event Tracking** - Compliance and threat detection
7. **Performance Budgets** - Specific metrics for UI responsiveness
8. **Error Boundaries** - Graceful degradation strategies
