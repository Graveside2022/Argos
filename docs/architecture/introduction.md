# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Argos, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

This is a brownfield project with significant existing infrastructure. The current system consists of 200+ shell scripts, mixed process management, and hardcoded paths across multiple services. Our architecture takes an evolutionary approach, maintaining compatibility with existing hardware integration scripts while modernizing the core application stack.
