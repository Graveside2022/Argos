        const correlations = await threatIntelligence.correlateThreatData(indicators);
        
        expect(correlations).toHaveLength(greaterThan(0));
        expect(correlations[0]).toHaveProperty('confidence');
        expect(correlations[0].confidence).toBeGreaterThan(0.7);
    });
    
    test('should generate accurate threat forecasts', async () => {
        const historicalData = await threatIntelligence.getHistoricalThreats();
        const forecast = await threatIntelligence.generateThreatForecast(historicalData);
        
        expect(forecast.accuracy).toBeGreaterThan(0.85);
        expect(forecast.timeHorizon).toBeLessThanOrEqual(90); // days
    });
});

// Autonomous SOC testing
describe('Autonomous SOC Operations', () => {
    test('should autonomously detect and respond to threats', async () => {
        const simulatedThreat = await createAdvancedThreatSimulation();
        const response = await autonomousSOC.processIncident(simulatedThreat);
        
        expect(response.detectionTime).toBeLessThan(30); // seconds
        expect(response.responseTime).toBeLessThan(300); // seconds
        expect(response.effectiveness).toBeGreaterThan(0.9);
    });
});
```

### **Performance Benchmarks:**
```typescript
// Strategic platform performance metrics
interface PerformanceBenchmarks {
    threatIntelligenceProcessing: {
        maxLatency: 5000; // ms
        throughput: 10000; // indicators/minute
        accuracy: 0.95;
    };
    autonomousSOC: {
        detectionTime: 30; // seconds
        responseTime: 300; // seconds
        falsePositiveRate: 0.05;
    };
    executiveReporting: {
        reportGenerationTime: 60; // seconds
