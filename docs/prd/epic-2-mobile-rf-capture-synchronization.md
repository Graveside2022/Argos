# Epic 2: Mobile RF Capture & Synchronization

Enable the existing RF capture capabilities to work effectively on a mobile aerial platform, synchronizing all signal data with precise 3D position information for accurate signal mapping.

## Story 2.1: Position-Synchronized Capture

As a signal analyst,
I want RF captures tagged with exact position data,
so that I can accurately map signal sources.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: HackRF sweep process modified to accept position input
2: Each sweep bin tagged with lat/lon/alt/timestamp
3: Position interpolation for samples between GPS updates
4: Synchronization accuracy within 10ms
5: Fallback to last known position if GPS lost
6: Position data included in WebSocket streams

## Story 2.2: Mobile Platform Adaptations

As a field operator,
I want the RF system to handle drone movement,
so that captures remain accurate during flight.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Sweep parameters optimized for mobile operation
2: Antenna pattern compensation based on drone orientation
3: Vibration filtering applied to signal processing
4: Adaptive sample rates based on flight speed
5: Buffer management prevents data loss during maneuvers
6: Health monitoring detects hardware issues

## Story 2.3: 3D Signal Recording

As a mission analyst,
I want all signals recorded with 3D position data,
so that I can perform volumetric analysis.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Signal database stores altitude with lat/lon
2: Flight path recorded at 10Hz minimum
3: Signal strength interpolated between measurements
4: 3D bounding box calculated for each flight
5: Export includes elevation data
6: Storage optimized for large datasets

## Story 2.4: Real-Time Stream Enhancement

As a ground station operator,
I want to see signals appear on the map as detected,
so that I can guide the drone to areas of interest.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: WebSocket stream includes position with signals
2: Latency under 100ms from detection to display
3: Stream handles intermittent connectivity
4: Buffer and retry for disconnections
5: Bandwidth optimization for cellular links
6: Priority queuing for critical alerts
