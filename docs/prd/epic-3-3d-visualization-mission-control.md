# Epic 3: 3D Visualization & Mission Control

Create comprehensive 3D visualization capabilities and mission planning tools that enable operators to effectively plan, execute, and monitor aerial RF survey missions.

## Story 3.1: 3D Tactical Map

As a mission commander,
I want to see drone and signals in 3D space,
so that I can understand vertical signal distribution.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Cesium or Three.js integrated for 3D visualization
2: Drone model shows real-time position and orientation
3: Signal sources rendered as 3D volumes
4: Terrain elevation data integrated
5: Camera controls for orbit/pan/zoom
6: Performance maintains 30fps with 1000 signals

## Story 3.2: Mission Planning Interface

As a mission planner,
I want to define search areas and patterns,
so that the drone can execute autonomous surveys.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Draw search area on map (polygon/circle)
2: Select flight pattern (grid/spiral/perimeter)
3: Set altitude and speed parameters
4: Calculate estimated flight time and coverage
5: Save and load mission plans
6: Export to autopilot format (MAVLink/QGC)

## Story 3.3: Flight Controls Integration

As a pilot,
I want drone control from the Argos interface,
so that I can respond to detected signals immediately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Arm/disarm controls with safety confirmations
2: Takeoff/land/RTL commands
3: Guided mode for click-to-fly on map
4: Altitude and speed adjustments
5: Emergency stop with immediate hover
6: Control state clearly indicated

## Story 3.4: Mission Execution Monitor

As a mission operator,
I want to track mission progress in real-time,
so that I can ensure complete coverage.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Progress bar shows area coverage percentage
2: Breadcrumb trail of completed path
3: Remaining battery vs. mission estimate
4: Current waypoint and ETA
5: Deviation alerts from planned path
6: Quick mission abort option
