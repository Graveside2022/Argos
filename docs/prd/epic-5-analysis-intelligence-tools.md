# Epic 5: Analysis & Intelligence Tools

Develop comprehensive post-flight analysis and intelligence gathering tools that transform raw RF data into actionable insights.

## Story 5.1: Flight Replay System

As an analyst,
I want to replay flights with full data,
so that I can analyze signal patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Timeline scrubber for entire flight
2: Synchronized 3D view and signal data
3: Variable playback speed (0.1x - 10x)
4: Jump to events of interest
5: Multiple flight comparison
6: Export replay as video

## Story 5.2: Signal Intelligence Reports

As an intelligence officer,
I want automated signal analysis reports,
so that patterns and anomalies are identified.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Identify new signals vs. historical baseline
2: Cluster analysis for related signals
3: Movement pattern detection
4: Signal strength heat maps
5: Automated anomaly detection
6: Export as PDF/HTML reports

## Story 5.3: Area Coverage Analytics

As a mission planner,
I want coverage analysis tools,
so that I can optimize future missions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Coverage maps showing surveyed areas
2: Signal density visualization
3: Gaps and overlap analysis
4: Temporal coverage (time since scan)
5: Multi-mission aggregation
6: KML export for external tools

## Story 5.4: Signal Database Integration

As a data analyst,
I want flight data integrated with the historical database,
so that long-term trends are visible.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Automatic import after landing
2: Signal correlation across flights
3: Baseline generation from multiple flights
4: Change detection between flights
5: Statistical analysis tools
6: API for external analysis tools
