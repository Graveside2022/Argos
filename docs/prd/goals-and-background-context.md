# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable autonomous aerial RF signal detection and localization using drone-mounted HackRF and Raspberry Pi
- Provide real-time signal strength mapping and visualization capabilities  
- Create a mobile platform for identifying and tracking wireless devices, drones, and RF emitters
- Deliver an MVP system that can detect signals and guide drone toward signal sources
- Establish foundation for advanced features like direction finding and signal classification
- Integrate with existing Argos infrastructure for seamless operation
- Support both manual and autonomous flight modes for flexible deployment
- Enable post-flight analysis and signal intelligence gathering

## Background Context
The proliferation of wireless devices and drones has created a need for mobile RF detection capabilities. Traditional stationary monitoring systems cannot effectively cover large areas or track mobile RF sources. This project leverages affordable SDR hardware (HackRF) with existing software infrastructure (DragonOS/GNU Radio) to create an autonomous aerial platform that can detect, localize, and track RF emissions. The system addresses security monitoring, research, and network management use cases by providing a cost-effective solution for RF environment mapping.

The Argos platform already provides comprehensive RF signal detection, visualization, and analysis capabilities. By extending these features to an aerial platform, we can dramatically increase coverage area, improve signal localization accuracy through 3D positioning, and access otherwise unreachable signal sources. The integration leverages existing HackRF sweep capabilities, real-time WebSocket streaming, and the tactical map visualization system.
