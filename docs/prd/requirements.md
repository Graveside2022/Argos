# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- **FR1**: The system shall interface with drone telemetry (MAVLink) to receive real-time position, altitude, and orientation data
- **FR2**: The system shall synchronize RF signal captures with drone position data for accurate 3D signal mapping
- **FR3**: The system shall support real-time signal strength visualization on a 3D tactical map
- **FR4**: The system shall enable autonomous flight patterns based on signal strength gradients
- **FR5**: The system shall record all flight and signal data for post-flight analysis
- **FR6**: The system shall provide signal direction finding using RSSI triangulation from multiple positions
- **FR7**: The system shall classify detected signals by type (WiFi, cellular, drone control, etc.)
- **FR8**: The system shall support manual override of autonomous flight at any time
- **FR9**: The system shall display battery life and estimate remaining flight time based on power consumption
- **FR10**: The system shall support geofencing to prevent drone from entering restricted areas
- **FR11**: The system shall detect and track multiple signal sources simultaneously
- **FR12**: The system shall generate heat maps showing signal intensity across surveyed areas

- **NFR3**: The system shall maintain stable operation in vibration conditions typical of drone flight
- **NFR4**: The system shall consume less than 15W total power for RF equipment
- **NFR5**: The system shall maintain GPS lock with 3m accuracy during flight
- **NFR6**: The system shall store at least 2 hours of continuous signal data
- **NFR7**: The system shall support WiFi or LTE connectivity for real-time data streaming
- **NFR8**: The system shall continue core functions if ground station connection is lost
- **NFR9**: The system shall be weather resistant for operation in light rain
- **NFR10**: The system shall boot and be operational within 60 seconds
