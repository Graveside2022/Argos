# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create an intuitive, mission-focused interface that enables operators to plan flights, monitor real-time signal detection, and analyze results without extensive training. The UI should prioritize critical information visibility and support both pre-planned and reactive operations.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Mission-Centric Workflow**: All interactions organized around mission lifecycle (plan → execute → analyze)
- **Real-Time Prioritization**: Live data prominently displayed with historical context
- **Touch-Friendly Controls**: Large buttons and gestures for field tablet operation
- **Minimal Cognitive Load**: Automated processes with manual override options
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features accessible but not overwhelming

## Core Screens and Views
- **Mission Planning Screen**: Define search area, flight parameters, and signal targets
- **Live Operations Dashboard**: Real-time map, signal list, drone telemetry, and controls
- **Signal Detail View**: Detailed analysis of selected signal with history and characteristics
- **3D Flight Visualization**: Replay flights with signal captures in 3D space
- **Analysis Dashboard**: Post-flight data exploration, pattern recognition, and reporting
- **System Configuration**: Hardware setup, calibration, and preferences

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The system will meet WCAG AA standards for contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support where applicable. Field operation constraints may require some accommodations.

## Branding
Maintain consistency with existing Argos visual design:
- Dark theme optimized for outdoor visibility
- Monochrome base with color coding for signal types
- Military/tactical aesthetic with clean, professional appearance
- Geometric backgrounds and technical typography

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
- Primary: Tablet devices (iPad, Android tablets) for field operation
- Secondary: Desktop browsers for mission planning and analysis
- Mobile phone as emergency backup control interface
