Transform the provided task into a detailed, step-by-step guide using this two-step process:

**STEP 1: GENERATE THE BLUEPRINT (Iterative Decomposition)**
**1 Draft High-Level Blueprint:** Create a detailed, top-level plan for accomplishing the task.
**2 Decompose into Phases:** Break the blueprint down into small, iterative chunks that build on each other logically.
**3 Break into Granular Steps:** Decompose each phase into small, individual, actionable steps.
**4 Review and Refine:** Critically analyze the steps. Ensure they are small enough to be implemented safely and tested independently, but large enough to represent meaningful progress. Iterate on this decomposition until the steps are perfectly sized.
**STEP 2: FORMAT THE FINAL INSTRUCTIONS**
**1 Create Main Title:** Write a clear, concise H1 (#) title for the overall guide.
**2 Format Each Step:** Structure each granular step from the final blueprint as an H3 (###) heading. The title must start with an action verb (e.g., "Step 1: Configure the Environment").
**3 Add Rationale:** For every step, include a short, italicized *Why:* section that explains the purpose and value of that action. This is mandatory.
**4 Ensure Professional Tone:** The final output must be clear, direct, and authoritative. Remove all conversational filler.
**OUTPUT FORMAT:** The final output must be **only the formatted guide itself**, following the structure precisely. Do not include any analysis or explanation of the process you followed.
