## 🔄 Remediation Strategy

### Option A: Full Remediation

**Impact:** Resolves all 2 violations
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Risk:** LOW

**Approach:**

1. Review all violations in detail
2. Apply fixes systematically (file-by-file or phase-by-phase)
3. Run tests after each change
4. Verify compliance with audit tool

---

### Option B: Incremental Remediation

**Impact:** Resolve violations gradually during normal development
**Timeline:** 2-3 months
**Risk:** LOW

**Approach:**

1. Fix violations as you touch related files
2. Add exemption annotations for deferred work
3. Track progress with periodic audits

---

### Option C: Constitutional Exemption

**Impact:** ZERO (no code changes)
**Timeline:** 15 minutes (documentation)
**Risk:** ZERO

**Approach:**
Add exemption to affected files:

```typescript
// @constitutional-exemption: Article III §3.2 issue:#999
// Justification: [Reason for exemption]
```

## ⚖️ Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level:** LOW

### 🟢 LOW RISK

**No Dependency Risks** ✅

This remediation requires zero new dependencies.

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

### ✅ **Recommended Approach for Test Coverage**

**Priority:** Should fix soon

**Recommendation:** Option A (Full Remediation) - High ROI

HIGH priority violations represent 2 issues that should be addressed. The estimated timeline of 2-3 weeks is reasonable for the impact gained.

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**

- Dependencies: ZERO
- Risk: LOW
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks
- Impact: Resolves 2 violations

## 📖 Next Steps

### If Proceeding with Remediation:

1. **Review this analysis** and choose an option (A, B, or C)
2. **Create git branch:** `feature/${category.folderName}`
3. **No installation needed** - ready to proceed
4. **Verify baseline:**
    ```bash
    npm run typecheck
    npm run lint
    npm run test
    ```
5. **Begin implementation** following the chosen option
6. **Re-run audit** after completion: `npm run constitutional-audit`

### If Deferring Remediation:

1. **Add exemption annotations** to affected files
2. **Create GitHub issue** tracking the technical debt
3. **Set timeline** for future remediation
4. **Re-run audit** to verify exemptions applied correctly
