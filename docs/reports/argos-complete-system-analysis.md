## Real-time Data Streaming Architecture

### WebSocket Implementation Patterns (from @14's analysis)

1. **Mixed Approach**: 
   - WebSockets for bidirectional communication
   - Server-Sent Events (SSE) for unidirectional streams (e.g., RTL-433)

2. **Centralized Management**:
   - `FusionWebSocketManager` handles all service subscriptions
   - Channel-based routing for different data streams

3. **Service-Specific Optimizations**:
   - **Kismet**: Poll-and-distribute pattern with caching
   - **HackRF**: Compressed spectrum data streaming
   - **RTL-433**: SSE for efficient one-way streaming

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Data throttling: 500ms update intervals
   - History limits: 50 entries per buffer
   - Spectrum data compression
   - Smart caching strategies

5. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Svelte stores for reactive state management
   - Auto-reconnection logic
   - Connection status tracking per service

## Frontend Architecture

### Component Organization
- Service-specific stores in `/src/lib/stores/`
- Modular UI components in `/src/lib/components/`
- Real-time visualization components for each service
- Unified dashboard integrating all services

### Key UI Features
- Real-time spectrum visualization (HackRF)
- Device tracking maps (Kismet)
- Signal strength meters and indicators
