## Architecture Analysis (from %14)

ArgosFinal is a sophisticated web-based RF monitoring platform with:

1. **Frontend**: SvelteKit with TypeScript for modern, reactive UI
2. **Modular Architecture**: Clean integration of multiple RF tools (HackRF, Kismet, RTL-433, GNU Radio)
3. **Real-time Streaming**: WebSocket connections for all RF tools
4. **Unified Dashboard**: Fusion Security Center consolidates all data sources
5. **Tactical Mapping**: GPS/RSSI-based device localization
6. **Standardized APIs**: Consistent interface patterns across all services
7. **Service Management**: Each tool has dedicated start/stop/status controls
