# LAF - LoRa Attack Framework

> **DUPLICATE ENTRY** — This tool is the same as `03-attack-hardware/lora-attack-toolkit.md`.
> Both reference the same repository: https://github.com/IOActive/laf
>
> **See the authoritative documentation at: `../03-attack-hardware/lora-attack-toolkit.md`**

## Repository

https://github.com/IOActive/laf

## Key Facts (from the authoritative doc)

- **NOT pure Python** — Go + Python hybrid with PostgreSQL database
- Uses `docker-compose` with 3 services: LAF tools container, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin
- The Go shared library (`lorawanWrapper.so`) handles LoRaWAN protocol processing
- Python scripts handle data collection (MQTT, UDP packet forwarder, TTN, ChirpStack)
- Works at the **network infrastructure level** (gateway-to-server), not via LoRa radio hardware directly
- Actual dependencies: `paho-mqtt, sqlalchemy, psycopg2-binary, python-dateutil, websocket_client, requests`

## Why This Was a Separate Entry

This file was originally created as a distinct "LoRa Attack Framework" entry in the IoT exploits category. However, it references the identical IOActive/laf repository already documented in `03-attack-hardware/lora-attack-toolkit.md`. The previous content of this file contained fabricated script names (`laf.py`, `--module scan`, `--module otaa_hijack`) and incorrect technology stack descriptions ("pure Python", "USB serial LoRa transceiver"). All of that content was incorrect.

For the complete, verified documentation of IOActive LAF, refer to the folder 03 entry.
