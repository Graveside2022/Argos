## Tool Description

Bl0ck is a targeted WiFi deauthentication tool that improves on basic broadcast deauth by providing intelligent client selection and prioritization. It supports MAC-based blacklisting and whitelisting for selective denial of service, automated access point tracking with channel hopping, client enumeration and prioritization based on activity level, and persistent deauthentication campaigns against specific targets. Bl0ck is designed for scenarios requiring precise control over which clients are disconnected rather than indiscriminate broadcast deauthentication.

## Docker Compatibility Analysis

### Can it run in Docker?

**YES** - Bl0ck runs cleanly in Docker with privileged access and host networking. It is a Python script with minimal dependencies beyond Scapy and standard wireless tools.

### Host OS-Level Requirements

- `--privileged` - Required for raw 802.11 frame injection and monitor mode interface control
- `--net=host` - Required for direct access to wireless interfaces in monitor mode
- `--device=/dev/bus/usb` - USB passthrough for external WiFi adapter
- Host kernel modules: `cfg80211`, `mac80211`, `mt76x2u` (Alfa adapter driver)
- WiFi adapter must be in monitor mode (configured on host or within privileged container)

### Docker-to-Host Communication

- Direct wireless interface access via `--net=host` and `--privileged`
- No IP-layer network ports required (operates at raw 802.11 layer)
- Target lists and MAC filters can be mounted from host: `-v /host/config:/config`
- Logs and results via volume mount: `-v /host/output:/output`

## Install Instructions (Docker on Kali RPi 5)

### Option A: Native Install

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git python3 python3-pip python3-scapy aircrack-ng wireless-tools iw

git clone https://github.com/MS-WinCrypt/bl0ck.git /opt/bl0ck
cd /opt/bl0ck
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 2>/dev/null; true
```

### Option B: Docker

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    aircrack-ng \
    wireless-tools \
    iw \
    net-tools \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir scapy

RUN git clone https://github.com/MS-WinCrypt/bl0ck.git /opt/bl0ck

WORKDIR /opt/bl0ck
ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "bl0ck.py"]
```

```bash
# Build
docker build -t argos/bl0ck .

# Prepare monitor mode on host
sudo airmon-ng start wlan1

# Run - deauth all clients on target AP
docker run --rm -it \
  --privileged \
  --net=host \
  -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
  argos/bl0ck -i wlan1mon -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF

# Run - deauth specific client only
docker run --rm -it \
  --privileged \
  --net=host \
  -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
  argos/bl0ck -i wlan1mon -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -c 11:22:33:44:55:66

# Run - with MAC blacklist (deauth only listed clients)
docker run --rm -it \
  --privileged \
  --net=host \
  -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
  -v $(pwd)/blacklist.txt:/config/blacklist.txt \
  argos/bl0ck -i wlan1mon --blacklist /config/blacklist.txt
```

## Kali Linux Raspberry Pi 5 Compatibility

### Architecture Support

**ARM64 NATIVE** - Bl0ck is a pure Python script using Scapy for packet crafting. Python 3 and Scapy are fully supported on ARM64. No compiled components.

### Hardware Constraints

- CPU: Extremely lightweight. Deauthentication frame crafting and injection is trivial for Cortex-A76 cores
- RAM: Minimal memory usage (~30-50MB with Scapy loaded). Negligible impact on 8GB
- WiFi: Requires adapter with monitor mode and packet injection support. Alfa AWUS036AXML (mt76x2u) fully compatible
- No GPU or additional hardware required

### Verdict

**COMPATIBLE** - Bl0ck runs without issues on RPi5. Pure Python codebase with Scapy eliminates any architecture concerns. The tool provides more granular control over deauthentication targeting compared to aireplay-ng or mdk4. Lightweight enough for continuous operation on RPi5. Native install from GitHub recommended.
