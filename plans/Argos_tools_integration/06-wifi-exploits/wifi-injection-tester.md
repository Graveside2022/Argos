## Tool Description

WiFi Injection Tester is a Python-based diagnostic tool for verifying that a wireless network adapter properly supports monitor mode and packet injection. It sends a series of crafted 802.11 frames at different rates and on different channels, then listens for acknowledgement to confirm the adapter and driver stack can successfully inject raw frames into the wireless medium. This is a prerequisite validation step before running any active WiFi exploitation tool (mdk4, aireplay-ng, wifiphisher, etc.). The tool tests injection across multiple frame types including broadcast, directed, and fragmented frames, and reports per-rate success/failure statistics. It does not perform any attack -- it purely validates adapter capabilities.

## Docker Compatibility Analysis

### Can it run in Docker?

**YES** -- WiFi Injection Tester is a lightweight Python script with minimal dependencies. It requires privileged access to the wireless adapter in monitor mode but has no complex build requirements.

### Host OS-Level Requirements

- `--privileged` -- Required for raw 802.11 frame injection and monitor mode control
- `--net=host` -- Required for direct access to host wireless interfaces in monitor mode
- `--device=/dev/bus/usb` -- USB passthrough for external WiFi adapter (Alfa AWUS036AXML)
- Host kernel modules: `cfg80211`, `mac80211`, `mt76x2u` (Alfa adapter driver)
- WiFi adapter must be placed in monitor mode on the host before container launch, or the container must have privileges to do so

### Docker-to-Host Communication

- Monitor mode interface must be configured on the host (`airmon-ng start wlan1` or `iw dev wlan1 set type monitor`)
- No network port mappings required (operates on raw 802.11 layer, not IP layer)
- Test output via stdout or volume mount: `-v /host/output:/output`

## Install Instructions (Docker on Kali RPi 5)

### Option A: Native Install (Recommended)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-scapy aircrack-ng iw wireless-tools

git clone https://github.com/rpp0/wifi-injection.git /opt/wifi-injection
cd /opt/wifi-injection
pip3 install scapy
```

### Option B: Docker

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    iw \
    wireless-tools \
    aircrack-ng \
    net-tools \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir scapy

RUN git clone https://github.com/rpp0/wifi-injection.git /opt/wifi-injection

WORKDIR /opt/wifi-injection
ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]
```

```bash
# Build
docker build -t argos/wifi-injection-tester .

# Prepare monitor mode on host (run before container)
sudo airmon-ng start wlan1

# Run - test injection capability on monitor mode interface
docker run --rm -it \
  --privileged \
  --net=host \
  -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
  argos/wifi-injection-tester injection_test.py wlan1mon

# Run - test injection on specific channel
docker run --rm -it \
  --privileged \
  --net=host \
  -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
  argos/wifi-injection-tester injection_test.py wlan1mon -c 6
```

## Kali Linux Raspberry Pi 5 Compatibility

### Architecture Support

**ARM64 COMPATIBLE** -- Pure Python tool with no native compilation required. Scapy and all dependencies install cleanly on ARM64 via pip and apt.

### Hardware Constraints

- CPU: Extremely lightweight Python script. A single Cortex-A76 core handles all test modes without measurable load
- RAM: Minimal memory usage (~30-50MB including Python interpreter), negligible impact on 8GB available
- WiFi: Requires adapter with monitor mode and packet injection support. Alfa AWUS036AXML (mt76x2u) is fully compatible
- No GPU or additional hardware required

### Verdict

**COMPATIBLE** -- WiFi Injection Tester is one of the lightest tools in the WiFi exploit category. Pure Python with scapy dependency means zero compilation issues on ARM64. This is a diagnostic-only tool that should be the first step before deploying any active injection tool. Native install is recommended for minimal overhead. Run this before any WiFi engagement to confirm adapter injection capabilities.
