## Available for Integration

No additional TEMPEST tools identified. TempestSDR is the primary open-source tool in this category.

## Hardware Requirements

- HackRF One (installed) or RTL-SDR
- Directional antenna for EM pickup
- Proximity to target display (effectiveness decreases with distance)

## Notes

- Named after the NSA codename for investigating compromising emanations
- Effective range depends on shielding, cable type, and antenna quality
- Works best against unshielded HDMI/VGA cables
