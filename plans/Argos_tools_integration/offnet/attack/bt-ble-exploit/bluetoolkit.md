## Tool Description

BlueToolkit is a comprehensive Bluetooth Classic and BLE attack framework that combines device discovery, service enumeration, vulnerability scanning, and exploit execution into a unified toolkit. It supports a wide range of Bluetooth attacks including PIN cracking, pairing abuse, service impersonation, and known CVE exploitation against common Bluetooth stacks. The toolkit provides both interactive and scriptable interfaces for chaining multiple attack stages.

## Docker Compatibility Analysis

### Can it run in Docker?

**YES** - BlueToolkit runs in Docker with privileged mode and Bluetooth adapter passthrough. All Python dependencies are installable within a container environment. The host Bluetooth adapter must be accessible to the container.

### Host OS-Level Requirements

- `--privileged` - Required for raw Bluetooth HCI socket access
- `--device=/dev/bus/usb` - USB passthrough for external Bluetooth adapters
- `--net=host` - Required for Bluetooth HCI stack communication (BlueZ uses netlink sockets)
- Host kernel modules: `bluetooth`, `btusb`, `bnep`, `rfcomm` must be loaded
- Host BlueZ stack must be installed and `bluetoothd` running for HCI device management

### Docker-to-Host Communication

- Host must have BlueZ installed and running (`sudo systemctl start bluetooth`)
- Bluetooth adapter must be visible via `hciconfig` on the host before container launch
- Adapter can be brought up on host (`hciconfig hci0 up`) or within privileged container
- Results output via volume mount: `-v /host/output:/output`

## Install Instructions (Docker on Kali RPi 5)

### Dockerfile

> **NOTE**: BlueToolkit has a complex install process with ~10 submodule tools. The Dockerfile below installs the core `bluekit` framework. The full install (with braktooth, blueborne, internalblue, etc.) requires running the repo's `install.sh` which is designed for Vagrant/bare-metal.

```dockerfile
FROM kalilinux/kali-rolling:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    python3-venv \
    python3-dev \

# Clone BlueToolkit (main repo) and the bluekit submodule
RUN git clone --recursive https://github.com/sgxgsx/BlueToolkit.git /opt/bluetoolkit

WORKDIR /opt/bluetoolkit

# Install bluekit core in a venv
RUN python3 -m venv /opt/bluetoolkit/.venv && \
    /opt/bluetoolkit/.venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip && \
    /opt/bluetoolkit/.venv/bin/pip install \
    pwntools cmd2 scapy psutil tqdm pyyaml tabulate colorama pyserial pyelftools && \
    /opt/bluetoolkit/.venv/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/pybluez/pybluez.git#egg=pybluez && \
    cd /opt/bluetoolkit/bluekit && \
    /opt/bluetoolkit/.venv/bin/pip install .

ENV PATH="/opt/bluetoolkit/.venv/bin:$PATH"

ENTRYPOINT ["bluekit"]
CMD ["--help"]
```

### Build and Run

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t argos/bluetoolkit .

# Ensure Bluetooth adapter is up on host
sudo hciconfig hci0 up

# Run - interactive mode (bluekit is a cmd2-based CLI)
docker run --rm -it \
  --privileged \
  --net=host \
  --device=/dev/bus/usb \
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/output \
  argos/bluetoolkit

# Run - with specific command
docker run --rm -it \
  --privileged \
  --net=host \
  --device=/dev/bus/usb \
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  argos/bluetoolkit --help
```

## Kali Linux Raspberry Pi 5 Compatibility

### Architecture Support

**ARM64 SUPPORTED** - BlueToolkit is a pure Python application with no architecture-specific compiled components. All dependencies (PyBluez, BlueZ bindings) are available for ARM64 on Kali Linux. The Raspberry Pi 5 onboard Bluetooth adapter or an external USB Bluetooth adapter can be used.

### Hardware Constraints

- CPU: Python-based tool with minimal CPU requirements; 4x Cortex-A76 is more than sufficient
- RAM: Lightweight memory footprint (~100-200MB); well within 8GB
- Bluetooth Hardware: Requires a Bluetooth adapter supporting HCI commands. The RPi 5 onboard Bluetooth (BCM2712) works for basic operations; an external USB adapter (e.g., CSR 4.0 or Sena UD100) is recommended for advanced attacks requiring raw HCI access or extended range

### Verdict

**COMPATIBLE** - BlueToolkit runs natively on Kali ARM64 without modification. Docker deployment works with privileged mode and Bluetooth adapter passthrough. Native install is also viable via `apt` and `pip` on Kali.
