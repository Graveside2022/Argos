## Tool Description

Bluing is a comprehensive Bluetooth security assessment tool that combines reconnaissance and attack capabilities for both Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR) and Bluetooth Low Energy. It performs device discovery, service enumeration (SDP for Classic, GATT for BLE), vulnerability scanning against known CVEs, PIN brute-forcing, and targeted exploitation. Bluing outputs structured scan results in JSON format, making it well-suited for integration with security dashboards and automated assessment pipelines. The tool is actively maintained and tracks new Bluetooth vulnerabilities.

## Docker Compatibility Analysis

### Can it run in Docker?

**YES** - Bluing runs in Docker with Bluetooth adapter passthrough. It is a Python application that interfaces with the Linux BlueZ stack for Bluetooth operations.

### Host OS-Level Requirements

- `--privileged` - Required for raw HCI socket access and Bluetooth device control
- `--net=host` - Required for BlueZ/HCI socket communication
- `--device=/dev/bus/usb` - USB passthrough if using an external Bluetooth adapter
- Host kernel modules: `bluetooth`, `btusb`, `rfcomm`, `bnep`, `hidp`
- Host BlueZ stack must be running (`systemctl start bluetooth`)

### Docker-to-Host Communication

- Host must have BlueZ installed and Bluetooth service active
- Bluetooth adapter must be up on host (`hciconfig hci0 up`)
- D-Bus socket sharing for BlueZ integration: `-v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus`
- Scan results and logs via volume mount: `-v /host/output:/output`

## Kali Linux Raspberry Pi 5 Compatibility

### Architecture Support

**ARM64 NATIVE** - Bluing is a Python package installable via pip on ARM64. Its dependencies (PyBluez, pydbus, pycryptodome) are all available for ARM64 on Kali Linux. No architecture-specific compiled components beyond standard BlueZ C bindings.

### Hardware Constraints

- CPU: Python-based scanning and enumeration is lightweight; vulnerability scanning with brute-force components may use moderate CPU on Cortex-A76 but well within capability
- RAM: ~100-200MB typical usage; well within 8GB
- Hardware: Requires a Bluetooth adapter supporting HCI commands. The RPi 5 onboard Bluetooth (BCM2712) works for basic scanning and enumeration. An external Class 1 USB Bluetooth adapter is recommended for:
    - Extended range scanning
    - Advanced HCI operations that may not be supported by the onboard adapter
    - Running simultaneously with other Bluetooth tools

### Verdict

**COMPATIBLE** - Bluing runs natively on Kali ARM64 via pip install. Docker deployment is straightforward with privileged mode and Bluetooth passthrough. Strong candidate for Argos integration due to its structured JSON output, comprehensive scanning capabilities, and Python API.
