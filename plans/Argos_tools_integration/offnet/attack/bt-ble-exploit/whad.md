# WHAD — Wireless Hacking & Attack Device Framework

## Overview

Multi-protocol wireless attack framework for BLE, Zigbee, IR, and sub-GHz protocols. Active successor to the deprecated Mirage framework, developed by the same author (Romain Cayre).

## Links

- **GitHub:** https://github.com/whad-team/whad-client
- **Docs:** https://whad.readthedocs.io/
- **PyPI:** https://pypi.org/project/whad/

## What It Does

Sniffs, injects, replays, and fuzzes wireless protocols — BLE, Zigbee, IR, and sub-GHz. Supports multiple hardware backends (HackRF, nRF52, CC2531, Ubertooth, Sniffle, ButteRFly).

## Hardware Requirements

- **RAM:** ~150 MB
- **CPU:** ARM64 native (pure Python + C extensions)
- **SDR/Hardware:** At least one supported adapter (HackRF, Ubertooth, nRF52840 dongle, CC2531, or Sniffle BLE dongle)
- **Pi 5 8GB:** ✅ PASS

## Install on Raspberry Pi 5 (Kali ARM64)

### Native Install

```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv libusb-1.0-0-dev

# Install WHAD
pip3 install whad

# Or from source for latest:
git clone https://github.com/whad-team/whad-client.git
cd whad-client
pip3 install -e .
```

### Docker Install

```bash
# No official Docker image — run natively
# WHAD needs direct USB access to hardware adapters
```

## Capabilities

- BLE scanning, sniffing, MITM, injection
- Zigbee packet injection and replay
- IR signal capture and replay
- Sub-GHz protocol fuzzing
- Multi-hardware backend support
- Scriptable Python API
- Protocol-agnostic fuzzing framework

## Why We Care

Replaces the deprecated Mirage framework. Covers BLE + Zigbee + IR + sub-GHz in a single tool, reducing the number of specialized tools needed. Actively maintained by the original Mirage author.
