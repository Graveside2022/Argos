# tar1090

> **RISK CLASSIFICATION**: LOW RISK
> This tool is part of a controlled military/defense training toolkit. tar1090 is a passive web-based visualization frontend for ADS-B aircraft data. It does not interact with any radio hardware directly and only displays data already collected by dump1090 or readsb. No transmit or active scanning capability. Entirely legal as a data display layer.

## Deployment Classification

> **RUNS ON ARGOS RPi 5: YES** — Pure JavaScript frontend + lighttpd; architecture-independent; negligible server-side resource usage

## Tool Description

tar1090 is an enhanced web interface for displaying ADS-B aircraft tracking data collected by dump1090 or readsb. It replaces and significantly improves upon the default web interfaces provided by those decoders, offering better map rendering, persistent aircraft trail history, range ring display, heatmap generation, multi-receiver support, and a highly responsive user experience.

tar1090 is a pure frontend -- it reads aircraft JSON data produced by dump1090-fa or readsb and renders it on an interactive map. It does not handle any RF reception or decoding itself.

Key capabilities:

- Enhanced interactive map with aircraft positions, trails, altitude coloring, and speed vectors
- Persistent aircraft trail history with configurable retention (hours/days of track history)
- Globe history mode for long-term aircraft tracking and replay
- Range ring display showing receiver coverage area
- Heatmap generation showing aircraft density patterns
- Multi-receiver support -- aggregate and display data from multiple ADS-B receivers
- Highly optimized JavaScript frontend for smooth performance even with hundreds of aircraft
- Aircraft information panel with detailed flight data
- Military aircraft and interesting flight highlighting
- Configurable map layers (OpenStreetMap, satellite, terrain)
- URL-based aircraft selection and sharing
- Mobile-responsive design

## Docker Compatibility

### Can it run in Docker?

YES

### Docker Requirements

- Access to aircraft JSON data from dump1090-fa or readsb (via shared volume or network)
- A lightweight web server (lighttpd or nginx) to serve the static files
- Port mapping for the web interface (typically 8078)
- Typically deployed alongside a dump1090 or readsb container, sharing a data volume
- The community `mikenye/tar1090` or `ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-tar1090` images are available

## Install Instructions (Native)

```bash
# ============================================
# tar1090 Native Install on Kali Linux RPi5
# ============================================

# Prerequisites: dump1090-fa or readsb must be installed and running first
# tar1090 reads data from /run/dump1090-fa/ or /run/readsb/

# Install web server dependency
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y lighttpd git

# Clone tar1090
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090.git

# Run the official install script
# This script auto-detects dump1090-fa or readsb and configures accordingly
sudo bash /opt/tar1090/install.sh

# The install script will:
# - Copy web files to /usr/local/share/tar1090/html/
# - Configure lighttpd with proper aliases
# - Set up a systemd service for globe_history (optional)
# - Configure data source path automatically

# --- Manual install (if the script doesn't work on Kali) ---

# Create directories
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/tar1090/html
sudo cp -r /opt/tar1090/html/* /usr/local/share/tar1090/html/

# Configure lighttpd for tar1090
sudo tee /etc/lighttpd/conf-available/88-tar1090.conf << 'LIGHTEOF'
alias.url += (
    "/tar1090/data/" => "/run/readsb/",
    "/tar1090/" => "/usr/local/share/tar1090/html/"
)
$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/tar1090/data/.*\.json$" {
    setenv.add-response-header = ("Access-Control-Allow-Origin" => "*")
}
LIGHTEOF

sudo lighttpd-enable-mod tar1090
sudo systemctl restart lighttpd

# Verify installation
# Access web interface at http://<pi-ip>/tar1090/
# Or if standalone: http://<pi-ip>:8078/

# Verify data source exists
ls -la /run/dump1090-fa/ 2>/dev/null || ls -la /run/readsb/ 2>/dev/null
```

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ARM64 Support         | :white_check_mark: Pure JavaScript frontend + lighttpd, fully architecture-independent                                   |
| Kali Repo Available   | :x: Not in Kali repos, installed from GitHub via install script                                                          |
| Hardware Requirements | No direct hardware requirements -- only needs a running dump1090 or readsb instance providing aircraft data              |
| Performance on RPi5   | :white_check_mark: Excellent -- lightweight static web files served by lighttpd, negligible CPU/RAM usage on server side |

### RPi5-Specific Notes

- tar1090 is a standard component of the Raspberry Pi ADS-B receiver ecosystem
- Server-side resource usage is essentially zero (static file serving via lighttpd)
- All rendering happens in the client browser, not on the Pi
- Globe history mode writes to disk and may benefit from an SSD over SD card for long-term history storage
- Works perfectly alongside dump1090-fa and readsb on the same RPi5 without resource contention
- The lighttpd web server included in Kali repos works without modification

### Argos Integration Notes

- tar1090 can be embedded in Argos dashboard as an iframe pointed at `http://<pi-ip>:8078/`
- Alternatively, Argos can consume the same JSON data files that tar1090 uses (from `/run/readsb/aircraft.json`)
- tar1090's JavaScript codebase can serve as reference for implementing aircraft visualization directly in Argos
- The globe history feature stores aircraft data in gzipped JSON files that Argos could query for historical analysis
- Multi-receiver support allows consolidation of multiple ADS-B stations into one view
- CORS headers are configured to allow cross-origin access to JSON data endpoints

### Verdict

**COMPATIBLE** -- tar1090 is a lightweight web frontend with no hardware dependencies of its own. It is designed to run on Raspberry Pi alongside dump1090 or readsb and requires minimal resources. Installation via the official script handles all configuration automatically. The enhanced mapping and trail history features make it a valuable visualization complement to the core ADS-B decoder, and its data sources can be directly consumed by Argos.
