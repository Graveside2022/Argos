# Research: Do We Need Custom AI Models for SDR Recon/Attack & Network Penetration?

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Context:** Argos SDR & Network Analysis Console — Army EW Training on RPi5

---

## Executive Summary

**No, we do not need to build AI models from scratch.** For both SDR signal classification and network/device penetration in a military training environment, mature open-source models, datasets, and tools exist. Argos is primarily an **integration project**, not an ML research project.

## 1. SDR Signal Classification & Recon

### Existing Models (Ready to Use or Fine-Tune)

| Framework                                             | Description                                                                                        | License     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| [brysef/rfml](https://github.com/brysef/rfml)         | DARPA-coined "Radio Frequency Machine Learning" PyTorch library with pre-built AMC neural networks | Open Source |
| [cnn-rtlsdr](https://github.com/randaller/cnn-rtlsdr) | TensorFlow CNN classifying signals from raw IQ, FFT, or demodulated audio                          | Open Source |

### Existing Training Datasets (No Collection Needed)

| Dataset              | Contents                                                                      | Source                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| RadioML 2018.01      | 24 modulation types (ASK, PSK, QAM, AM, FM variants), generated via GNU Radio | DeepSig / O'Shea et al. |
| Panoradio HF Dataset | 18 waveform classes including digital modes (RTTY, PSK, FSK, OFDM) and analog | panoradio-sdr.de        |
| WBSig53              | Wideband multi-source detection simulating dense RF environments              | TorchSig project        |

### Proven Deep Learning Architectures

- **ResNet-50** with angular-margin losses for transferable signal embeddings
- **CVCNN-LSTM** for complex-valued IQ signal processing
- **CNN + BiLSTM + Attention (ICRNNA)** — state-of-the-art on RadioML benchmarks
- **Continual learning with Elastic Weight Consolidation** for evolving/unknown signal types

### What We Would Customize

1. **Fine-tuning for military threat signals** — FHSS, burst transmissions, specific military radios, drone control links. Collect samples with HackRF, transfer-learn on existing model.
2. **Anomaly detection layer** — Isolation Forest or Autoencoder for unknown/suspicious signals not matching any known pattern.
3. **Integration glue** — Python service: HackRF FFT WebSocket → ML model → classification results → Argos tactical map.

### RPi5 Inference Constraints

- Quantized/lightweight model (MobileNet-style) for on-device inference
- Optional Coral USB TPU accelerator (~$25) for hardware-accelerated inference
- Offload to companion server if available on training range
- Use LLM (Claude) for interpretation of pre-classified signals, not for raw classification

## 2. Network/Device Penetration (WiFi, Router, Bluetooth)

### Verdict: No Custom AI Needed — Existing Tools Suffice

**WiFi Attack Tools (all on Kali, our base OS):**

- **Wifite 4.0** — Fully automated WiFi auditing (WEP, WPA/WPA2, WPS)
- **Aircrack-ng 2.0** — WPA3 handshake cracking, multi-capture processing
- **Bettercap** — WiFi, BLE, and HID attacks from a single framework
- **Reaver/PixieWPS** — WPS brute force

**Bluetooth Attack Tools:**

- **Bettercap** BLE module — scan, enumerate, MITM BLE devices
- **BlueZ + gatttool** — GATT characteristic read/write for BLE exploitation

**Network/Router Exploitation:**

- **Metasploit** — Standard exploitation framework
- **Nmap** — Network discovery and vulnerability scanning
- **Hydra** — Credential brute force

### The LLM Agent's Role: Orchestration, Not Execution

```
Target detected on Argos map (e.g., rogue WiFi AP)
        │
        ▼
Claude Code agent receives target metadata
(SSID, BSSID, encryption, frequency, signal strength, GPS)
        │
        ▼
Agent REASONS: "WPA2 AP at -45dBm. Strategy: capture handshake → offline crack"
        │
        ▼
Agent EXECUTES existing tools (airodump-ng, aircrack-ng, wifite)
        │
        ▼
Agent REPORTS results to Argos tactical map
```

The LLM adds value in: decision-making, adaptation on failure, context awareness across targets, and automated after-action documentation.

## 3. Military Training Environment Advantages

1. **Authorization is pre-established** — Blanket RF and network ops authorization on range. Tools can run at full capability.
2. **Controlled RF environment** — Only need to identify specific threat emitters on range, not every signal in the wild. Dramatically reduces classification complexity.
3. **Offensive tools authorized** — Deauthentication, jamming (with spectrum coordination), active exploitation all in scope.
