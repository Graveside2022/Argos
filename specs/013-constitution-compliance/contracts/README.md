# Contracts: Constitution Compliance Remediation

No new API endpoints or contracts are introduced by this feature.

This is a refactoring effort that preserves all existing public API signatures (FR-007).
Existing contracts remain unchanged — the only "contract" is that all refactored modules
must maintain their current export interfaces.
